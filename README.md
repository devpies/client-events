# Common Module For Events

This module supplies the event types and event definitions for Devpie's CQRS System Architecture.

The same events are specified in multiple languages. Support languages include:

- TypeScript
- Golang
- and Python

The base definition is defined in Typescript under `events.ts` and converted into other language using [Quicktype](https://quicktype.io/).
